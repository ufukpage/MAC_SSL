        Playback Speed Prediction, arXiv 20'03

    [3] Video Playback Rate Perception for Self-supervisedSpatio-Temporal
        Representation Learning, CVPR'20
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11476

    Since the speed prediction can be viewed as a classification problem,
    we just need to wrapper the TSN pt_model_3.
